                Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar born 24 April 1973 is an Indian former international cricketer who captained the Indian national team. He is regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of cricket.[4] He is the highest run scorer of all time in international cricket, and the only player to have scored one hundred international centuries, the first batsman to score a double century in a One Day International (ODI), the holder of the record for the most runs in both Test and ODI cricket, and as of 2021 the only player to score more than 30,000 runs in international cricket.[5] He was the only Indian cricketer included in an all-time Test World XI compiled in 2013 to mark the 150th anniversary of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack.[6][7] He is affectionately known as "Little Master" or "Master Blaster"
